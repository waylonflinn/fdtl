1. Directory Structure

the basic layout of this project is as follows:

	algorithm
		classes implementing the algoritms used to solve the
		finite-differenced pdes (gauss-seidel, sor, etc)

	problem
		classes defining various finite-differenced pdes.
		These include Laplace's equation and the simple harmonic
		oscillator

	interface
		classes handling interaction with the user.

	include
		miscellaneous files used by the project

	tools
		source for supporting programs (thomas-fermi, etc)

	sample
		sample input and output files

2. How-To

to create a new problem you can derive from the base problem class and
implement its virtual methods.

to change the user interface (command line options) derive a new class from
the interface base class or change the existing derived file.

for further explanation of class usage check for comments in the header files
(files ending in '.h') in the various directories.
