This page describes how to compile the executable for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on various platforms. The following platforms are known to be compatible.

  * GCC 4.1.2
    * Fedora Core 8
    * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5

The following steps will produce an executable named `mlt_gpe`. An explanation of it's use and applicability can be found on the [HowToUseGPE] page.

= GCC 4.1.2 =

  # download the source using subversion as described on the  [http://code.google.com/p/fdtl/source/checkout Source Page]
