== Input File ==

The input file describes the boundary conditions. All boundaries are rectangular. Each side may be assigned either Dirichlet (value) or Neumann (value of derivative) conditions. Both may occur in the same file.

Each line in the file...

  * specifies the condition along an edge of the bounding rectangle.
  * may be preceded by the words 'Dirichlet' or 'Neumann' to indicate that the line following specifies a boundary condition of that type.
  * maps to a boundary based on order. The mapping is as follows:
    * _TODO: add this_

Each character in a line...

  * gives the value at a particular point along the boundary
  * must be numeric.

An example may be found under version control [http://code.google.com/p/fdtl/source/browse/trunk/sample/input_detail.txt here]
